Instead, the TLC provides the pickup and drop off taxi zone for each trip, where the 263 zones\u2014[see here](https://toddwschneider.carto.com/viz/2961a180-ffb1-11e6-a29f-0e233c30368f/public_map) for a map\u2014roughly correspond to the neighborhoods of the city.\n\n80% of all taxi trips in the filtered dataset started and ended within one of the 82 zones that includes a Citi Bike station. Of the 20% that did not, about a third involved LaGuardia or JFK airports. Harlem and Astoria were the Citi Bike-less residential neighborhoods with the most taxi trips, though they are part of Citi Bike's [expansion plans](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170727/astoria/citi-bike-stations-update-queens-cb1-bike-share-sept-oct-2017).",
