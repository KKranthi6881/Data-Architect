It also maps census tracts to NYC's official neighborhood tabulation areas\n- `taxi_zones` table contains the TLC's official taxi zone boundaries. Starting in July 2016, the TLC no longer provides pickup and dropoff coordinates. Instead, each trip comes with taxi zone pickup and dropoff location IDs\n- `central_park_weather_observations` has summary weather data by date\n\n## Other data sources",
