These models may contain more columns than we may choose to publish to the dimensional data warehouse, but don't contain any reporting models.\n- `wh` represents the Dimensional Data Warehouse (WH). These models use a star schema methodology made up of fact (`fct_*`) and dimension (`dim_*`) tables. In addition, this schema contains report models (`rpt_*`) that combine fact and dimension tables for business reporting.\n\n\n\n## Profile\n- Add a new profile to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` called `tpch`.",
