    "response": "## Business Understanding\n\nThe business problem at hand is to analyze workflow success rates over time to identify trends and patterns. The primary objective is to optimize workflow efficiency and effectiveness. To achieve this, we need to focus on calculating completion rates for various categories of workflows.\n\n## Data Architecture Recommendation\n\nBased on the provided database schemas, I recommend using Schema 1 (Relevance: 9/10) as the foundation for our data architecture solution. This schema provides the necessary columns to calculate workflow completion rates over time, including `completion_date`, `workflow_category`, and `total_attempts`.\n\nTo incorporate moving averages into our analysis, we can create a new table that calculates the average success rate for each category over time. We can use this table to identify trends and patterns in workflow success rates.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nHere's an implementation approach using code patterns:\n\n1. Create a new table (`workflow_success_rates`) that calculates the moving averages of successful completions for each category:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE workflow_success_rates AS\nSELECT \n  workflow_category,\n  AVG(successful_completions) OVER (PARTITION BY workflow_category ORDER BY completion_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_average\nFROM \n  unknown_table;\n```\n2. Use this table to identify trends and patterns in workflow success rates:\n```sql\nSELECT \n  *\nFROM \n  workflow_success_rates\nWHERE \n  moving_average > (SELECT AVG(moving_average) FROM workflow_success_rates);\n```\n3. To calculate daily success rates, we can create a new column (`daily_success_rate`) that calculates the ratio of successful completions to total attempts for each day:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE unknown_table ADD COLUMN daily_success_rate DECIMAL(5, 2);\n\nUPDATE \n  unknown_table\nSET \n  daily_success_rate = successful_completions / total_attempts\nWHERE \n  completion_date >= (SELECT MAX(completion_date) FROM unknown_table);\n```\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Regularly update the `workflow_success_rates` table to reflect changes in workflow success rates over time.\n2. Use data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards that showcase trends and patterns in workflow success rates.\n3. Monitor and analyze user adoption metrics (from Schema 4) to identify areas for improvement.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nHere's a sample implementation plan:\n\n1. Week 1-2: Design and implement the `workflow_success_rates` table using the recommended schema design.\n2. Week 3-4: Develop code patterns for calculating moving averages, daily success rates, and identifying trends and patterns in workflow success rates.\n3. Week 5-6: Integrate data visualization tools to create interactive dashboards that showcase trends and patterns in workflow success rates.\n4. Week 7-8: Monitor and analyze user adoption metrics to identify areas for improvement.\n\nBy following this implementation plan, we can provide a comprehensive data architecture solution that addresses the user's question and supports their business objectives.",
