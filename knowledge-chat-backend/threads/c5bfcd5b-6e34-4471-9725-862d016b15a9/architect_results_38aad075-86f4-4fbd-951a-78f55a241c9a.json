The goal is to optimize workflow completion rates, which will increase productivity and efficiency.\n\nKey requirements:\n\n* Analyze workflow completion rates over time\n* Identify trends and patterns\n* Provide moving average calculations for each category\n\n## Data Architecture Recommendation\n\nBased on the business problem, I recommend the following database schema design:\n\n### Schema 1: unknown_schema (Relevance: 9/10)\n\nTable: unknown_table\n\nColumns:\n- completion_date (date)\n- workflow_category (string)\n- total_attempts (integer)\n- successful_completions (integer)\n- avg_satisfaction (decimal)\n\nThis schema is highly relevant to the business question because it provides a detailed analysis of workflow completion rates over time.\n\n### Schema 2: unknown_schema (Relevance: 9.5/10)\n\nTable: unknown_table\n\nColumns:\n- completion_date (date)\n- workflow_category (string)\n- total_attempts (integer)\n- successful_completions (integer)\n- rolling_7day_success_rate (decimal)\n\nThis schema is highly relevant to the business question because it provides a moving average calculation for each workflow category, which helps smooth out fluctuations in the data.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nTo implement this solution, I recommend the following approach:\n\n1. Create a new database and schema using dbt.\n2. Load the required data into the unknown_table from the Snowflake Sample Data repository.\n3. Use dbt to create the necessary models for the unknown_schema.\n4. Implement the moving average calculation for each workflow category using dbt macros.\n\nExample code:\n```sql\n{% macro moving_average(col, window) %}\n  {{ col }} / {{ window }}\n{%- endmacro %}\n\n{{ config(materialized='temporary') }}\n\nwith rolling_7day_success_rate as (\n  select \n    completion_date,\n    workflow_category,\n    total_attempts,\n    successful_completions,\n    moving_average(successful_completions, 7) as rolling_7day_success_rate\n  from unknown_table\n)\nselect * from rolling_7day_success_rate;\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nBest practices to consider:\n\n* Use dbt's built-in macros and functions to simplify the implementation.\n* Ensure data quality and accuracy by validating input data before processing it.\n* Monitor performance and adjust the moving average window size as needed.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\nHere is a sample implementation plan:\n\n1.
