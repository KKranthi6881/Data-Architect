# Data Architect Agent Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the Data Architect Agent system, focusing on enhanced error handling, more efficient repository management, and improved code parsing capabilities.

## Error Handling Enhancements

### JSON Parsing Improvements
- Added robust JSON extraction from LLM responses with the `_extract_json_from_response` method
- Implemented pattern matching to handle various JSON formatting scenarios
- Created fallback analysis mechanism when JSON parsing fails
- Enhanced logging to track parsing attempts and errors

### Fallback Analysis Mechanism
- Added `_create_fallback_analysis` method to provide intelligent question classification when parsing fails
- Implements keyword-based classification for development, code enhancement, and model info questions
- Extracts column names, file paths, and model references even when JSON parsing fails
- Preserves search terms and entities for continued operation

## Repository Management Optimizations

### Persistent Repository Storage
- Replaced temporary directories with persistent storage in `~/.dbt_data_architect/repos/`
- Implemented hash-based naming strategy for repository directories
- Added validation to ensure repository directories remain valid Git repositories

### Smart Repository Updates
- Added `_should_update_repo` method to check if remote changes exist before pulling
- Implemented Git fetch and comparison to determine if updates are needed
- Optimized performance by skipping unnecessary pull operations

### Repository Cache System
- Created a persistent JSON cache at `~/.dbt_data_architect/repo_cache.json`
- Added automatic loading of repository mappings on application startup
- Implemented validation to ensure cached repositories still exist
- Enhanced cleanup to preserve persistent repositories while removing temporary ones

## Code Quality Improvements

### Structured Search and Response Generation
- Enhanced question classification and routing
- Improved code enhancement and development instructions for clearer, more actionable guidance
- Added better context extraction for column searches and calculations

### Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the codebase
- Improved error messages with context for easier debugging
- Implemented tracing for search operations and repository management

## Usage

The enhanced repository management system automatically maintains cloned repositories between application restarts. When the Data Architect Agent is initialized:

1. It checks the repository cache for existing repositories
2. Validates that cached repositories still exist and are valid
3. For existing repositories, it:
   - Checks if remote changes exist before pulling
   - Only pulls changes when necessary
4. For new repositories, it:
   - Creates a persistent directory with a unique name
   - Clones the repository with optimized settings
   - Saves the repository location to the cache

## Implementation Details

### Repository Hash Generation
```python
def _get_repo_hash(self, repo_url: str) -> str:
    """Generate a unique hash for the repository URL"""
    import hashlib
    # Use the last part of the URL as a readable name prefix
    repo_name = repo_url.rstrip('/').split('/')[-1]
    # Add a hash suffix for uniqueness
    url_hash = hashlib.md5(repo_url.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
    return f"{repo_name}_{url_hash}"
```

### JSON Extraction Logic
```python
def _extract_json_from_response(self, response: str) -> str:
    """Extract a valid JSON string from a potentially noisy LLM response."""
    # Handle usual JSON code blocks
    if '```json' in response:
        # Get content between ```json and ```
        match = re.search(r'```json\s*(.*?)\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(1).strip()
    
    # Handle just code blocks without language specification
    if '```' in response:
        # Get content between ``` and ```
        match = re.search(r'```\s*(.*?)\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            candidate = match.group(1).strip()
            # Check if it looks like JSON
            if candidate.startswith('{') and candidate.endswith('}'):
                return candidate
    
    # Additional extraction methods...
    
    # Default - return the original response as is
    return response
```

## Future Work

- Implement periodic repository cleanup based on access patterns
- Add support for repository branch selection
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms for repository operations
- Implement caching of search results for frequently accessed models
