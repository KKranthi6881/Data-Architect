# Enhanced DBT Tools & Data Architect Agent

## Overview of Improvements

We've made significant enhancements to the DBT tools and Data Architect Agent to better handle complex searches, especially for column calculations and file path information. These improvements ensure that users receive accurate and detailed responses about DBT models, calculations, and data lineage.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Improved Column Search

- **Smart Column Name Extraction**: Added pattern recognition to identify column names in user queries
- **Calculation Detection**: Added capabilities to extract and format column calculations
- **Context-Aware Matching**: Added support for finding column definitions with surrounding context
- **Multi-Level Fallback**: If direct column matches fail, the system tries content-based search and part matching

### 2. Enhanced Content Search

- **Match Context Extraction**: Now captures multiple matching contexts with surrounding text
- **Clear Result Organization**: Results grouped by search term with highlighted matches
- **Path-Based Fallback**: If content search fails, tries path-based search

### 3. Better File Path Handling

- **Complete Path Information**: All results include full file paths displayed in code formatting
- **File Path Search**: Added dedicated search by file path pattern
- **Path Highlighting**: File paths are prominently displayed in search results

### 4. Calculation Extraction

- **Formula Recognition**: Added regex patterns to extract calculation logic
- **Clean Formatting**: Added methods to format calculations for better readability
- **Contextual Understanding**: Captures full calculation expressions with appropriate context

### 5. Improved Response Generation

- **Detailed Formatting**: Enhanced result formatting with proper headings and code blocks
- **File Path Emphasis**: File paths are clearly marked and properly formatted
- **Calculation Explanation**: Calculations are presented with explanations of their meaning

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Search Classes

1. **DbtSearcher**: Added methods for:
   - `search_by_column_name`: Finds columns with advanced pattern matching
   - `search_by_content`: Searches for text with context extraction
   - `search_by_file_path`: Searches by file path patterns
   - `extract_column_calculations`: Extracts and formats column calculations

2. **SearchResult**: Enhanced with additional fields:
   - `column_name`: For column-specific searches
   - `calculation`: For storing SQL calculations
   - `match_contexts`: For storing multiple matching contexts
   - `file_name`: For file-specific information
   - `yaml_path`: For schema file paths

### Data Architect Agent Improvements

1. **_search_columns**: Enhanced to:
   - Extract column patterns from questions
   - Handle special cases for financial calculations
   - Get related model info for each column

2. **_format_results_for_prompt**: Enhanced to:
   - Format file paths consistently
   - Present calculations with code formatting
   - Organize results by type and relevance

3. **Response Generation**: Enhanced to:
   - Include exact file paths
   - Show detailed calculation explanations
   - Present structured, readable responses

## Testing

The improvements have been thoroughly tested with:

1. A test suite that creates sample DBT models with complex column calculations
2. Tests for column search that verify calculation extraction
3. Tests for content search that verify context extraction
4. Tests for model dependencies that verify relationship tracking

## Usage Example

When a user asks about column calculations like "How is net_item_sales_amount calculated?", the system now:

1. Identifies "net_item_sales_amount" as a column name
2. Searches for this column across all models
3. Extracts the calculation logic when found
4. Formats the calculation for better readability
5. Provides the exact file path where the calculation is defined
6. Shows the full context of the calculation
7. Explains the calculation in plain language

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Machine learning-based column identification for more complex queries
2. Visualization of calculation dependencies
3. More sophisticated calculation analysis and explanation
4. Performance optimizations for large DBT repositories
