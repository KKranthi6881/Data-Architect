# Enhanced DBT Tools & Data Architect Agent

## Overview of Improvements

We've made significant enhancements to the DBT tools and Data Architect Agent to better handle complex searches, especially for column calculations and file path information. These improvements ensure that users receive accurate and detailed responses about DBT models, calculations, and data lineage.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Improved Column Search

- **Smart Column Name Extraction**: Added pattern recognition to identify column names in user queries
- **Calculation Detection**: Added capabilities to extract and format column calculations
- **Context-Aware Matching**: Added support for finding column definitions with surrounding context
- **Multi-Level Fallback**: If direct column matches fail, the system tries content-based search and part matching

### 2. Enhanced Content Search

- **Match Context Extraction**: Now captures multiple matching contexts with surrounding text
- **Clear Result Organization**: Results grouped by search term with highlighted matches
- **Path-Based Fallback**: If content search fails, tries path-based search

### 3. Better File Path Handling

- **Complete Path Information**: All results include full file paths displayed in code formatting
- **File Path Search**: Added dedicated search by file path pattern
- **Path Highlighting**: File paths are prominently displayed in search results

### 4. Calculation Extraction

- **Formula Recognition**: Added regex patterns to extract calculation logic
- **Clean Formatting**: Added methods to format calculations for better readability
- **Contextual Understanding**: Captures full calculation expressions with appropriate context

### 5. Improved Response Generation

- **Detailed Formatting**: Enhanced result formatting with proper headings and code blocks
- **File Path Emphasis**: File paths are clearly marked and properly formatted
- **Calculation Explanation**: Calculations are presented with explanations of their meaning

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Search Classes

1. **DbtSearcher**: Added methods for:
   - `search_by_column_name`: Finds columns with advanced pattern matching
   - `search_by_content`: Searches for text with context extraction
   - `search_by_file_path`: Searches by file path patterns
   - `extract_column_calculations`: Extracts and formats column calculations

2. **SearchResult**: Enhanced with additional fields:
   - `column_name`: For column-specific searches
   - `calculation`: For storing SQL calculations
   - `match_contexts`: For storing multiple matching contexts
   - `file_name`: For file-specific information
   - `yaml_path`: For schema file paths

### Data Architect Agent Improvements

1. **_search_columns**: Enhanced to:
   - Extract column patterns from questions
   - Handle special cases for financial calculations
   - Get related model info for each column

2. **_format_results_for_prompt**: Enhanced to:
   - Format file paths consistently
   - Present calculations with code formatting
   - Organize results by type and relevance

3. **Response Generation**: Enhanced to:
   - Include exact file paths
   - Show detailed calculation explanations
   - Present structured, readable responses

## Testing

The improvements have been thoroughly tested with:

1. A test suite that creates sample DBT models with complex column calculations
2. Tests for column search that verify calculation extraction
3. Tests for content search that verify context extraction
4. Tests for model dependencies that verify relationship tracking

## Usage Example

When a user asks about column calculations like "How is net_item_sales_amount calculated?", the system now:

1. Identifies "net_item_sales_amount" as a column name
2. Searches for this column across all models
3. Extracts the calculation logic when found
4. Formats the calculation for better readability
5. Provides the exact file path where the calculation is defined
6. Shows the full context of the calculation
7. Explains the calculation in plain language

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Machine learning-based column identification for more complex queries
2. Visualization of calculation dependencies
3. More sophisticated calculation analysis and explanation
4. Performance optimizations for large DBT repositories

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. Improved Repository Management

#### Problem
Previously, the system cloned a new copy of the repository for every user query, even if the repository had not changed. This was inefficient and led to increased disk usage and longer response times.

#### Solution
We've implemented a persistent repository storage system that:
- Stores cloned repositories in a permanent location (`~/.dbt_data_architect/repos/`)
- Only pulls updates when changes are detected in the remote repository
- Intelligently names repositories using a combination of repo name and hash
- Maintains a cache of repository locations between application restarts

#### Benefits
- Significantly faster response times for repeat queries
- Reduced disk usage and network traffic
- Improved reliability through smart repository validation
- Better user experience with faster initialization times

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling for LLM Responses

#### Problem
The question analysis system was failing when the LLM returned responses that weren't properly formatted as JSON, leading to cascading errors in the processing pipeline.

#### Solution
We've implemented a robust error handling system that:
- Extracts valid JSON from potentially malformed LLM responses
- Provides intelligent fallback analysis when JSON parsing fails
- Implements pattern-based question classification as a backup
- Properly handles different message formats in the state object

#### Benefits
- More resilient question processing
- Graceful degradation when LLM responses are malformed
- Improved logging for easier debugging
- Continued operation even when ideal conditions aren't met

### 3. Code Quality and Stability Improvements

#### Problem
The code was making assumptions about data structures and object types that weren't always valid, leading to runtime errors.

#### Solution
We've made several code quality improvements:
- Added proper type checking throughout the codebase
- Implemented defensive programming practices for handling various input formats
- Enhanced the search result processing to handle different return types
- Improved message extraction from various state object formats

#### Benefits
- More stable application with fewer runtime errors
- Better handling of edge cases
- Improved diagnostic information when errors do occur
- More maintainable and extensible codebase

## Implementation Details

### Repository Hash Generation
```python
def _get_repo_hash(self, repo_url: str) -> str:
    """Generate a unique hash for the repository URL"""
    import hashlib
    # Use the last part of the URL as a readable name prefix
    repo_name = repo_url.rstrip('/').split('/')[-1]
    # Add a hash suffix for uniqueness
    url_hash = hashlib.md5(repo_url.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
    return f"{repo_name}_{url_hash}"
```

### Smart Repository Update Check
```python
def _should_update_repo(self, repo_path: str) -> bool:
    """Check if the repository should be updated based on remote changes"""
    try:
        # Fetch latest changes without merging
        subprocess.run(["git", "-C", repo_path, "fetch"], check=True, capture_output=True)
        
        # Check if there are differences between local and remote
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["git", "-C", repo_path, "rev-list", "HEAD..origin/HEAD", "--count"],
            check=True, capture_output=True, text=True
        )
        
        # If count is > 0, there are changes to pull
        count = int(result.stdout.strip() or "0")
        return count > 0
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Error checking if repo needs update: {str(e)}")
        # Default to True if we can't determine
        return True
```

### JSON Extraction from LLM Responses
```python
def _extract_json_from_response(self, response: str) -> str:
    """Extract a valid JSON string from a potentially noisy LLM response."""
    # Handle usual JSON code blocks
    if '```json' in response:
        # Get content between ```json and ```
        match = re.search(r'```json\s*(.*?)\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(1).strip()
    
    # Handle just code blocks without language specification
    if '```' in response:
        # Get content between ``` and ```
        match = re.search(r'```\s*(.*?)\s*```', response, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            candidate = match.group(1).strip()
            # Check if it looks like JSON
            if candidate.startswith('{') and candidate.endswith('}'):
                return candidate
    
    # If the response itself is a JSON object
    if response.strip().startswith('{') and response.strip().endswith('}'):
        return response.strip()
    
    # Additional extraction methods for other formats...
    
    return response
```
